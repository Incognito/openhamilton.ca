The Feedback system will be meant for Open Hamilton to communicate
directly to the general public (users) and for users to interact 
with one another through comments. It will also support ranking 
and voting.

High-level Overview
-------------------

Users:	
	Can be registered or anonymous. Registered users must have
	a screen name and email, while Anonymous users can optionally
	use a screen name. If no screen name is provided by an
	Anonymous user, then they're screen name will show as
	'Anonymous.'

Feedback:
	Can come in the form of a Comment, Question, or Dataset
	Request, all of which have the same structue. Anyone can
	Respond to a Comment that is left and someone else can also
	Respond to that Response and so on.
	Feedback can also be upvoted or downvoted to show agreement
	or disagreement to what was said, respectively.
	Feedback will be subjected to the Sblam! spam checker before
	being published.

Apps/Datasets:
	If current Apps/Datasets are listed, users will be able to 
	rank them on a scale of interest. They may optionally be
	commented on as well.
	Tags may also be attached to Apps/Datatsets in order to help
	users filter them when searching.
